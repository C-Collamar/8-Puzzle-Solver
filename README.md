# 8-Puzzle-Solver
A C-implementation solving the 8-puzzle problem using the uninformed search strategy _BFS (Breadth-First Search)_ and heusitic search strategy _A*_. The goal is to empirically compare both strategies' space and time performance.

For each strategy, the program collects and outputs the following information:
* sequence of moves corresponding to the solution (e.g. up, down, left, right)
* total number of nodes expanded
* total number of nodes generated
* length of the solution path (number of moves)

## Test Cases
**Goal board configuration**:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Notes:
* While A* performs well even on the worst case, the program crashes before the [BFS function][1] completes due to its memory-hogging nature. Tested as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit Windows® 7 OS with Intel® Core™ i5 and 8 GB RAM.
* While there are 9! total number of configurations possible to input, only half of them are solvable. Read more about the solvability of certain configurations of the n-puzzle in this Wikipedia [article][2] or in this MathWorld [explanation][3].
